# ToyMachineRental

This is a simple java project, console-based program in Java. It's a very simplified application for a rental company.

# Features
1. Menu with 3 submenus.
2. Creating, editing and deleting customers with data stored in database (name, surename and autoincrement ID).
3. Creating, editing and deleting rental items with data stored in database (similiar to customer).
4. Transactions stored in database, so everything is avalable after program re-run.


# Technologies used
Java.
SQLite (database stores customer and rental items data with transactions).

#
Based on my first read SQLite tutorial (https://javastart.pl/baza-wiedzy/java-zaawansowane/bazy-danych-sqlite-w-javie).
